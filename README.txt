# **ci munje ku jalsi'u - an adaptation of Eliezer Yudkowsky's *Three Worlds Collide* as an opera**
by Liam Greenough (beacon515@gmail.com)

Basically nothing much here at the moment.  I'll populate the properly another time.  The project is to adapt [this](http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/) as an n-act opera, singing and all, in [Lojban](https://mw.lojban.org/papri/Lojban).

We'll see how that goes.

The general task list I'm running to so far:

- Copy the prose of *Three Worlds Collide* and make preliminary adaptations into libretto format (in progress)
- Make creative adaptations to prose, especially to render narrative exposition as dialogue; reexpress for dramatic effect
- Prepare the Lojbanic translation
- Make post-translation adaptations
- Compose the music, setting the music
- Prepare the final score
- ???
- PROFIT

With the kind permission of Eliezer Yudkowsky.
